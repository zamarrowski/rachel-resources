## Introduction
Yair is an lightweight command-line-tool to interact with [Clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair).
It is designed for the execution inside a CI Job, for example to determinate if an image can be deployed to the production environment.

It can also executed localy without much effort.

features:
  - easy to use
  - fast scans
  - scan public and private images
  - image security scoring - if an image has to many fixable vulnerabilities, yair will have an return code of 2
  - multiple output option:
    - table output
    - short table
    - json output
    - quiet mode
    - Rocket.Chat output

## Getting started
#### Configuration:
copy the "config.yaml.tmpl" of this repo an change it for your needs.
```yaml
---
clair:
  host: "localhost:6060"

output:
  format: table
  rocketchat:
    webhook_url: rocket-chat.com/hooks/...
    receiver: "#general,@admin"

fail_on:
  score: 379
  big_vulnerability: true
```
| Config Option | Description |
|---|---|
| clair::host | hostname of the Clair Server with Port
| output::format | specifys the output format, can be "json", "table", "short-table" or "quiet" | 
| output::rocketchat | Rocket.Chat ouput, leave config commented if you dont want to use it |
| output::rocketchat::webhook_url | url to the Rocket.Chat hook you configured for this output with http/https prefix |
| output::rocketchat::receiver | comma-seperated list of channels to send output to |
| fail_on::score | if the image vulerability score is above this value, th script will have an returncode of "2" |
| fail_on::big_vulnerability | if set to true, the script will have an returncode of "2", if the image has an vulnerability with severity "high" or higher |

Rename the customized "config.yaml.tmpl" to "config.yaml" and move it to the directory you want to execute it in. 
#### Usage:
The config.yaml will be made accessable for yair with a readonly docker volume:
``` 
docker run -v `pwd`:/opt/yair/config/:ro yfoelling/yair [registry]image[tag]
```
you can also change the source path to a fixed path where you config.yaml is located.

You can scan public images and private images. if you dont specify a tag, it will assume you want to scan latest.
```
docker run yfoelling/yair ubuntu
docker run yfoelling/yair myregistry.com/mynamespace/myimage:mytag
```

## Preview
#### "table"
This is a preview of a scan with output::format "table". Normaly images will have much more vulnerabilies, so you will get a bigger table.
"Version with fix" will be empty if the vulnerability is not fixed yet for the distributions.

```


## Return codes
If the scan exits with return code 2, then the scanned image has either:
- an vulnerability with severity "high" or higher
**OR** 
- a score above 379

you can configure these thresholds in the config.yaml "fail_on" section.

## Image scoring
If an vulnerability is detected and there is already a version of the affected package with a fix, then a number will be added to the score depending on the severity:

| Severity | Score |
|---|---|
| Unknown | 0 |
| Negligible | 1 |
| Low | 16 |
| Medium | 81 |
| High | 265 |
| Critical | 625 |
| Defcon1 | 1296 |
